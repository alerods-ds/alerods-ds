🎓 **About Me**

My name is **Alejandro Rodríguez**, and I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina 🇦🇷.  
I'm currently finishing my **PhD in Theoretical Physics** at the University of Buenos Aires, where I focus on **string theory**, **string dualities**, and the mathematical structures underlying our physical world.  

While I remain deeply engaged with fundamental research, I'm also very excited about pivoting into the field of **data science**. I love uncovering patterns, making sense of complex systems, and using code to bring ideas to life.
